 * RNNoise Demo Usage Guide
 * ------------------------
 * This program demonstrates noise reduction using RNNoise.
 * 
 * Usage:
 *   ./rnnoise_demo <input_file> <output_file>
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   input_file  : Path to the input audio file (16-bit PCM)
 *   output_file : Path where the denoised audio will be saved
 * 
 * Requirements:
 *   - Input must be 16-bit PCM audio
 *   - Frame size is fixed at 480 samples
 *   - Sample rate should be 48kHz
 * 
 * Example:
 *   ./rnnoise_demo noisy_speech.pcm denoised_speech.pcm
 * 
 * Note: If USE_WEIGHTS_FILE is defined, the program will look for
 *       a weights file named "weights_blob.bin" in the current directory.
